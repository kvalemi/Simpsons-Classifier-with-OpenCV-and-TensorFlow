## Project Description: 

I obtained an images dataset of the popular TV show The Simpsons and created a very simple classifier using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model will take as input pictures of Simpson's characters and will predict which character is in the picture. The model was trained in Kaggle's Notebook environment with the help of their powerful GPU's!


## How to Build the Project:

1) Create a new notebook in Kaggle

2) Import the Simpsons dataset (link in Credits section)

3) Run the notebook located in this repo to train the classifier

4) At the bottom there is a relative path variable of a picture which will be fed as input to the trained model. Feel free to change it to any relative path in Kaggle's dataset environment.
